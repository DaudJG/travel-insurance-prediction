# Travel Insurance Prediction Analysis


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify customers who are most likely to purchase a travel insurance package, including Covid coverage, from a Tour & Travels Company. Utilizing a dataset from 2019 that includes information on approximately 2000 customers, we perform comprehensive data exploration, conduct statistical analysis, and apply various machine learning techniques to predict customer behavior. This analysis helps in understanding the key factors influencing insurance purchases, enabling the company to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.
